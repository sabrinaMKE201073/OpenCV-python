Computer Vision with OpenCV Python

---

Content: 
- navigate and manipulate images using popular Python libraries such as OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
- Load images with OpenCV and plot them using Matplotlib.
- Combine two images side-by-side with Pillow in Python, opening up endless creative possibilities for image manipulation.
Convert images into grayscale and its RGB (Red,Green,Blue) channels, allowing you to experiment with different color schemes and tones.
- Use indexing of Numpy arrays to crop and manipulate images, providing you with even more creative control over your image processing projects
